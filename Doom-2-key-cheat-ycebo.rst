 · Doom 2 Easter Egg. There's an Easter egg hidden near the very end of the game that's very easy to miss. In the last level, use the IDCLIP cheat and walk through the final boss to enter a hallway where you'll find the disembodied head of the game's director, John Romero. Shoot his head to beat the game.  · You can enter the following cheats for the corresponding effects. IDDQD - God Mode; IDKFA - All Ammo + Keys; IDFA - All Ammo No Keys: IDCLEV## - Level Select (Replace ## with number of level). In Macintosh Doom II games, typing a cheat code may fire the currently-held weapon, as all cheat codes include the D key, which is the default Fire key.
