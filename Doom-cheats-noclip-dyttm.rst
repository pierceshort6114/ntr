In certain source ports, the idfa and idkfa cheats also include a backpack if the player does not have one already. Some source ports enable both no-clipping cheats (idspispopd and idclip) to function while playing either game. Besides the codes below, vanilla Doom cheats are changed as follows: idspispopd and idclip are both available with any IWAD. They may also be entered in the console as noclip. iddt is generalized to the console variable am_cheat. The vanilla states become values of Estimated Reading Time: 7 mins.  · No clipping. Equivalent to typing "noclip" in the console. Contrarily to vanilla Doom, this cheat works in Doom/The Ultimate Doom even without allcheats on. idclevxy: Warps to level ExMy or MAPxy. Equivalent to typing "idclev xy" in the console. iddqd: Sets health to % (even if higher!) and makes player immune to damage.
