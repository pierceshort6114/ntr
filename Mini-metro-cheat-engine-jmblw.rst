Mini Metro is a puzzle strategy video game developed by New Zealand indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail transit network for a rapidly growing city.

The goal of Mini Metro is to see how many passengers your can appease before your public transportation system falters. Throughout the game, you will need to manage the chaos of overcrowded stations, passenger demands, and gridlock.  · Mini Metro [Origin] Well I can say that seeing what accesses the address is basically the manual way, and the Pointer scanner is a tool to do it for you but it just scans all possible pointers/paths and you have to refine it down as paths stop working/functioning; so a lot of people prefer to do it manually.
