Toca Boo is made for kids as young as 4 yet can capture excitement of those much older. It's filled with surprises - there are no limits, just fun! Come play! *** ABOUT TOCA BOCA At Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and . Toca Boo is a kids game where you must float around a huge house scaring a family. It sounds simple and it is. The fun is in simply watching the different family members get scared silly. The original artwork in Toca Boo gives it added charm and there are no annoying ads or in-app purchase prompts to plague your kids. In Toca Boo, you aren't a literally ghost. Instead, you play a small girl dressed up like a ghost who's trying to scare her family members. Despite having some of the trappings of a horror game, this isn't an experience designed to frightened. Successfully spooking one of your targets will result in comical animations of them becoming scared.
